This project is using [**Gradle Kotlin DSL**](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) as well as the [Plugin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html#sec:plugins_block) to setup the build.

Dependencies are centralized inside the [Dependencies.kt](buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/Dependencies.kt) file in the `buildSrc` folder. This provides convenient auto-completion when writing your gradle files.

## Static Analysis üîç

This project is using [**ktlint**](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint) with the [ktlint-gradle](https://github.com/jlleitschuh/ktlint-gradle) plugin to format your code. To reformat all the source code as well as the buildscript you can run the `ktlintFormat` gradle task.

This project is also using [**detekt**](https://github.com/detekt/detekt) to analyze the source code, with the configuration that is stored in the [detekt.yml](config/detekt/detekt.yml) file (the file has been generated with the `detektGenerateConfig` task).
